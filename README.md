# SSBU-Matchups

A collection of community-sourced advice for every Matchup in Super Smash Bros Ultimate, used as the source for [SmashMatchsups.com](http://www.smashmatchups.com).

## How to contribute

This repository is structured in the format of `/your_character/opponent_character.md`. For example, the file found at `/mewtwo/bowser.md` shows tips for the Mewtwo-Bowser matchup, with advice for the character playing Mewtwo - where `/bowser/mewtwo.md` will have advice for the Bowser.

### Generic Files

As of this writing, there are as many as 81 characters (depending on how you count) - creating thousands of potential matchups. In order to make sure there is some content available for every matchup - each character also has a generic `how_to_beat.md` - which can be shown when specific matchup data isn't available. Eventually, we should hope to show none of those generic results for any matchup.

### Matchup Style Guide

In order to keep pages somewhat consistent, pages must adhere to this common style:

1. Start with a **Character vs. Character** heading
2. Split suggestions into categories such as
  - Winning Neutral
  - Disadvantage
  - Edgeguarding
  - Dealing with Projectiles
  - Stage Meta
  These are not requirements, just suggestions. Not every matchup needs to have all the same sections. But splitting it up into sections makes it more quickly scannable, especially inbetween online battles.
