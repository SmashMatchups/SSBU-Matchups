# How to beat Fox 

## Neutral

- Fox has several good approaches - dash attack combos into uptilt
  - Uptilt combos aren't always true, if you have quick attacks, you can get out maybe
- Neutral Air is a typical approach, which can be mixed up a lot
  - It's quite safe on shield - try to parry
  - Depending on your character, you can stuff it out, or outspace and punish
- Shield is decently strong against fox, since his grabs are poor


## Disadvantage

- When being up-aired, don't spam dodge - thats what they want.
  - Just drift to the side, and take your damage
- When you're at the edge, they might bair spam, which is scary. 
  - Try to mix up your escape as best you can.  

## Advantage

- When you have advantage on fox, go in fast and hard
- He's a fast faller, so can be juggled well
- He's very light - death percent is low
- His recovery is punishable, but may take practice to not be hit back
