# How to beat Sheik

## Neutral

- Unparalleled frame data and power set of Neutral moves.
- Sheik mains tend to spam F-air and N-air, which are seemingly unpunishable.
- Following F-tilt after shield is one way of dealing some damage.
- Sheik’s Neutrals are better than most characters.
- However, even a single breakthrough can lead to a win.
- Avoid being predictable with ranged moves.

## Disadvantage

- Sheik lacks good finishers due to her abysmal kill power.
- DI-out whenever getting stuck in a combo 
- Her overall DPS is low — trading blows can often prove beneficial.
- Learn to avoid or counter Sheik’s Bouncing Fish with a sword-attack.

## Advantage

- Avoid edge-guarding Sheik unless they’re quite predictable. 
- Ledge-trapping would be the safer option.

## Stage Meta
- Stages with immense blast zones can work in your favor — including Kalos and Battlefield.
