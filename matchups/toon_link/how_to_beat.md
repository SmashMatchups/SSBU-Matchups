# How to beat Toon Link 

## Neutral

- Toon link will try to control the whole stage with his projectiles
- Between bomb/arrow/boomerang, he may stick to a certain pattern
- Don't approach blindly, but try to predict and work around it
- He may be aggressive and approach with aerials - they're mostly safe, so shield them out and punish after, or stuff them out early
- His bombs are more useful than the other Links - they come out quick and combo into kill moves

## Disadvantage

- His recovery is very linear
  - Can be spiked with good aim/timing
- He's pretty floaty - but can use bombs to keep you away
  - If he doesn't have a bomb yet - attack quick before he can get it out
