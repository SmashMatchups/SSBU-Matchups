# How to Beat Little Mac

## Neutral

- Little Macs will look to overwhelm you with constant offence
- They will use Down Tilt to safely attack shield
- A good tactic for Macs is to use Up Tilt when on top of you as it comes out fast and hits both in front and behind them
- Little Mac also has a frame one jab which catches a lot of people out
- Generally Macs will rain down Smash Attacks thanks to their frames of Super Armor

## Advantage

- Mac doesn’t really have any combos, but landing one hit will often give them any opening that leads to more
- Like Ganondorf, Mac will get most of his openings from hard reads and landing Smash Attacks
- The key to not suffering too much damage is teching any falls, abusing ledge invincibility and playing around the platforms (where possible)
- Mac’s Forward Tilt is a great KO move, comes out fast and the second hit with hit an opponent after the first hit clanks
- Be aware that Mac can angle his F-Smash down for big damage (shield included) and angle it up for KOs

## Disadvantage

- Any time Mac has to leave the ground (even simply by jumping) he is in disadvantage
- Mac naturally struggles against anyone with projectiles
- By flooding him with projectiles or staying on platforms, this will force Mac to play patiently, jump to meet you, or bait out an attack
- Mac’s Dash Attack is very bad against shield, so this can be punished easily if he does this

## Off Stage

- Mac is very easy to fight off stage 
- All his aerials are bad and there is essentially no chance of a reversal
- Mac is a fast faller, and has bad air mobility
- Mac does not get his Side B back if he gets hit, so hitting him after he uses it will almost guarantee him losing a stock
- Good Macs will use their Counter as an extra piece of recovery
- Baiting this out in mid air will stop all of his air momentum
- The only real thing Little Mac can do to opponents off stage is to try and two-frame with his Down Smash

## Stage Picks

- Little Mac doesn’t really excel at any stage, but smaller stages naturally suit him better
- The best bans are probably Final Destination and Smashville
