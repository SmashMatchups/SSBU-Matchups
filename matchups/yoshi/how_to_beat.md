# How to beat Yoshi 


## Neutral

- Yoshi will approach from the air usually
- Most moves don't have great range though, and can be contested
- Projectile camping will work really well - he has to full hop over projectiles
- Eggs can be parried, and are laggy - they can be punished well.
- Buffer an attack when you've been in an egg
- No kill throws, so shield a lot at high percents
