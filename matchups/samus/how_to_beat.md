- You'll have to approach, due to all of her projectiles and range
- She'll mix up her responses to your approach - either firing CS, grabbing, or fairing.
- The key to success to to mix up your approach as much as possible
- Foxtrot to whiff punish is a good one
- CS kills at high percents, and does a decent amount of damage - but don't panic by it.
  - Stay at a range you can react to.
- CS also may hit your hanging animation
