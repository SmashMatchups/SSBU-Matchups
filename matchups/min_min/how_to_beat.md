# How to Beat Min Min

## Neutral

- Min Min’s two arm attacks will be a pain for most people, she’ll often try to use tilts and approach simultaneously to apply pressure
- You’ll often have to jump to get around her Tilts, but beware as both her Up Tilt and Up Smash are effective anti-airs
- Her Down Tilt is basically the same as Cloud’s, allowing her to move forward with a hit box which she can use to duck under aerials
- She can also use Nair as a way to safely approach or counter aerials
- Always be aware of what Min Min has as her second arm to know what attacks she might attempt

## Advantage

- If Min Min lands one of her arm hits, they’ll more than likely keep up this pressure by using continuing arm attacks as they true combo at low percents
- Min Min players will often switch to Megawatt Arm when opponents are at higher percents for its big kill potential and high shield damage
- Min Min can also “gimp” players very early by using her back throw at ledge followed up by an instant Dragon Laser Attack

## Disadvantage

- Min Min will want to get you off of her as soon as possible and establish distance, so the best place to be is right next to her
- Up Tilt and Down Smash are Min Min’s best “get off me” tools, so hold shield when up close to see how much your opponent likes to “press buttons”
- She can also use Down Tilt to cross up shielding opponents, so be aware of the need to turn around
- Fast Rush Down Characters like Captain Falcon, Fox, and Mario will give Min Min a hard time if they can get in and stay in
- Bait out her Smash Attacks or her grab as these leave her wide open if she misses

## Off Stage

- Min Min can make certain recoveries a nightmare with her well timed Ram Ram attacks that hit below ledge
- Utilise a tether recovery if your character has one
- Going high where possible can often be better, or try stalling and mixing up your timings for your jumps and/or Up B
- Min Min’s recovery isn’t great, and her angle of recovery is fairly predictable and linear
- She lacks any real reversal potential off stage, so challenge her as much as possible while she’s recovering

## Stage Picks

- Min Min wants to keep you at mid to long range, so avoid larger stages like Town & City and Final Destination
- Min Min will really struggle on Smashville, Lylat, Battlefield, and Yoshi’s
- Use the platforms to maneuver around her arm attacks
