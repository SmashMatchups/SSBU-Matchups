# How to beat Ganondorf 

## Neutral:

- Ganon can seem relentlessly powerful - but realize he works by punishing your approaches.
- Keeping a safe distance while also making sure youâ€™re not cornering yourself is the way to win.
- Ganondorf wants to control center stage and pressure with tilts, jabs, u-airs and b-airs.
- Zoning/Camping works great on Ganon, as he constantly tries to approach or bait bad options instead.
  - Just be ready to run away if he closes the distance
- Be patient with his bait and punish - until you can get them in an edge guarding situation.

## Disadvantage:
- His recovery is quite linear. He will most likely Up-B, this is when you react. 
- Learn to rock-crock if you have good aerial punishes for it

## Stage Meta:
- Ganon excels at closing distances, so small maps are his playground such as Smashville. 
- Try going for multiplat stages which will help you jump away from him, and depending on your character get you avenues to punish his approaches.
