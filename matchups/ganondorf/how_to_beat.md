# How to Beat Ganondorf

## Neutral

- Though similar in style to Captain Falcon, Ganondorf plays very differently
- Often cited by pro players as one of the worst characters, Ganondorfs can suffocate you quickly if you let them
- Ganon’s will most likely approach with Nair due to its very low landing lag and high damage
- Other than that, they typically will try to punish your approaches, especially online
- Good Ganons will do the same combo starter as Falcon (Grab + Down Throw to Nair)
- Dash Attack is also a combo starter which will often be followed by an Up Air

## Advantage

- As Ganondorf is very slow and his frame data is bad, his advantage window is quite small
- That said, his damage will come from hard reads and gambles, so avoid being predictable or picking the same options over and over (e.g. rolling from ledge)
- Ganondorf’s can sometimes chain Flame Chokes (Side B) or will punish those who don’t tech with Down Airs or Smash Attacks
- On platform stages like Battlefield, be very cautious on the lower two platforms as Ganon’s F-Smash and Up Smash both shark the majority of the platform and can kill very early

## Disadvantage

- Ganon is heavy and has bad air mobility, so try to keep him in the air
- His best out of shield option is his standard Jab but most characters have other OoS options that can beat this
- The majority of his attacks like Wizard’s Foot, Flame Choke, and Dark Dive all leaving him massively exposed for a punish
- The same goes for his Smash Attacks

## Off Stage

- Ganondorf can be *“rock crocked”*
  - This is when you get in the way of his Up-B recovery, and tech the hit when it blasts you against the stage
  - After this, you can perform an aerial on him, depending on your character
- Ganon will more than likely defend the ledge in the same way as Falcon, except will probably use Nair as a way to KO fighters that go low
- Be careful when near the ledge to not get “Ganon-sided” (Ganon uses Side B just above ledge to drag you both to the Blast Zone)
- They will most likely try this just after you respawn to take an instant stock
- Challenge Ganon at all times off stage as he needs all his resources to make it back
- Forcing him to go low will often cause him to not make it back to stage

## Stage Picks

- Ganondorf is a brawler with no projectiles, so he likes close quarters like Smashville and Yoshi’s Story
- Platforms allow his Smash Attacks to shark
- Go for FD, T&C, and PS2
