# How to beat Captain Falcon 

## Neutral

- Falcon will be looking to start some combos on you at early percent
- But his approaches are pretty predictable - give them space and punish

## Disadvantage

- Falcons recovery is very predictable and punishable.
- See if your character has some good rock-crock spikes
  - This is when you intentionally get hit by his recovery up-b, tech the stage spike, and retaliate
