# How to Beat Captain Falcon

## Neutral

- Almost all of Falcon’s combos will start with Down Throw, especially at low percents
- DI this down and/or away as they will try to follow up with a quick Nair or multiple Up Airs
- Raptor Boost (Side B) works well against opponents that like to short hop and drift in with aerials thanks to its Super Armor on activation
- However this is a big commitment for Falcon as it has a lot of end lag
- Falcon’s can also use their Falcon Dive (Up B) or their Rapid/Gentleman Jab as a good out of shield option

## Advantage

- Falcon wants to juggle with Up Airs and will often use Grab + Down Throw to do this
- Time your Neutral Air Dodge to ghost through these Up Airs
- Alternatively DI towards stage as the Cap will look to push you out and try to land a killing blow with an Up B
- Combo breaking moves like Luigi Cyclone (Luigi’s Down B) or Counters like Incineroar’s Revenge! Are good for breaking the Up Air strings

## Disadvantage

- Falcon is a glass cannon; he is either comboing people or getting combo’d himself
- As mentioned, Falcon will want to start most combos with Down Throw, so he will most likely be trying to grab at lower percents
- Making Falcon commit to a Raptor Boost or Falcon Dive will leave him very exposed
- Try to learn how and when your opponent will use these moves and then punish them accordingly
- His Dash Attack is very unsafe on shield, so if he uses this punish with a shield grab

## Off Stage

- Falcon’s has good aerials that can kill effectively if he sweet spots
- Back Air is probably his most likely option to use against off stage opponents
- Alternatively he can also use weak knee (sour spot Fair) to keep you away if you drift too low
- Falcon has a linear recovery and can be gimped by “rock crocking”
- This involves letting Falcon grab you with his Falcon Dive, teching against the stage, holding forward (towards Blast Zone) and performing an immediate aerial
- Be cautious if Falcon recovers with a midair Raptor Boost as this will spike you straight down
- The same goes for his Up Tilt as this also spikes hard

## Stage Picks

- Falcon loves Yoshi’s Story and Kalos as he can utilise wall jumping off the stage to mix up his recovery
- Yoshi’s Story is probably his most preferred stage due to the low ceiling
- Avoid tri-plats to stop his Up Air strings
- FD, Town & City, or PS2 are safer bets that offer him no real advantage
