# How to beat Mario 

Mario will approach in Neutral using lots aerials.
You can't punish them out of shield, they're all very safe.
Instead, space away, and punish the approach if you have good disjoints.
Grabs can also lead to combos, so defensive spacing is key

His primary weakness is range. Focus on outranging.
Be careful with shield pressure - his up smash is invincible and quick.
Avoid triplats - he can do platform combos that are miserable.
DI away to reduce combos.
Some Marios will fish for Fair spikes offstage, just be vigilant
