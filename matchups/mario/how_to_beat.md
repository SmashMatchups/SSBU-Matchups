# How to beat Mario 


## Neutral

- Mario will approach in Neutral using lots aerials.
- You can't punish them out of shield, they're all very safe.
- Instead, space away, and punish the approach if you have good disjoints.
- Mario Grabs can also lead to combos, so defensive spacing is key.
- His primary weakness is range. Focus on outranging.
- Be careful with shield pressure - his up smash is invincible and quick.

## Disadvantage
- Some Marios will fish for Fair spikes offstage, just be vigilant
- Don't recover too high, or FLUD may get you
- DI away to reduce combos.

## Stage Meta

- Avoid triplats - he can do platform combos that are miserable.
