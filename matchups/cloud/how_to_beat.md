# How to beat Cloud 

## Neutral

- Cloud's gameplay revoles around Limit Break. Here's some quick stats:
  - Takes around 5 seconds of charging to get it
  - Lasts 15 seconds, or until he uses a special
  - His movement speed is improved significantly during it
- Don't be a hero when he goes blue. Play defensively.
  - Forcing him to use his recovery special will get rid of it as well
- Cross slash (the big blue attack) has barely any end lag - be careful punishing.
- Blade Beam can be reflected or shielded easily. 
  -  Make sure to hold shield down for the full attack.
- Cloud is really good at spacing with his long aerials
- Some clouds may spam Up B, but it's super punishible if you just shield the up and down hits of it.
- His grabs are terrible. Shielding is good against cloud.

## Disadvantage

- If you have a predictable recovery, Cross Slash can easily stage spike you.

## Weaknesses

- Clouds recovery is pretty terrible
  - Two frames and gimps can take early stocks
  - Unless he has Limit - but then you've made him waste it, which is good
- Anticipate him trying to save his Limit buy attack high recoveries
