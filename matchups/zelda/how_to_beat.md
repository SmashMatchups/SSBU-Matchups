# How to beat Zelda 

## Neutral

- Zelda will use her many zoning options to keep you away, and force unsafe approaches.
- Patience is the key to beating a Zelda, assess before moving. 
- Camp away from her, or be aggressive from the get go to counter this. 
- Learn the timings for her dash attack and her neutral B, don’t go out of shield too quickly. 

Disadvantage:
- They’re always willing to Up B at you from off stage.
 - Stay ready with your shield up if you see them Up B from above the ledge.
- If you throw a Zelda into disadvantage, just play aggressively as she can’t do anything if she has no room to breathe.

Stage Meta:
- Dreamland is a good call to bring Zelda to. The stage is atrocious for edge-cancels and that removes a lot of her mobility.
- Don't take a Zelda to Battlefield. There is too much they can do with ledge-cancels and extending strings.
