# How to Beat R.O.B

## Neutral

- R.O.B is all about making you approach, so a lot of the time people will have gyro ready or in play at almost all times
- R.O.B will use gyro to control your movement on the ground
- He can pressure you from range with his Robo-Beam and defending against incoming aerials with his Nair
- He can also use his strong Back Air to mix up timings and move himself away from you at the same time

## Advantage

- R.O.B can terrorize other players with aerial combos
- He can start this with a Dash Attack that can lead into multiple Forward Airs
- R.O.B players also like to land with Nairs to cover a good portion of both grounded and aerial opponents
- At low percents R.O.Bs will use Up Throw and combo aerials
- At high/kill percents they will bury with their Down Throw and use Up Smash to kill, so practice your mashing

## Disadvantage

- If you do manage to get close to R.O.B, he can utilize his Jab and Down Tilt which come out fast (frame 3) to get you off of him (Down Tilt can also trip)
- If you’re right on top of his shield his Up Smash is a great option for him as it scoops up opponents next to him
- R.O.B’s gyro can be a pain to try and pick up, but if you can turn it against him most players won’t be prepared for this
- Getting R.O.B to commit to his F-Smash or his Side B leaves him the most vulnerable

## Off Stage

- He can ruin characters with bad recoveries his Forward Air
- Players often try to intercept with a Side B, so use Neutral Air Dodge to get through this
- He can pressure at ledge with his Down Smash to cover rolling
- Alternatively he can use a delayed Back Air to punish Neutral Get Up
- R.O.B’s love to go high with their recovery, much like Snake does
- It’s better to try and keep them low and have them stall as this will waste their Up B usage and potentially cause an SD

## Stage Picks

- Ban FD
- Having no platforms will make it much harder to play around the gyro
- Lylat is a good counter pick as its harder for him to place the gyro directly on ledge as Lylat’s ledges are angled
