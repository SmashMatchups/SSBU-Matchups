# How to Beat Incineroar

## Neutral

- Incineroar can use Nair to drift in effectively much like Mario can
- Up Tilt is also a good move for him to use when very close as it hits both sides
- If they’re feeling confident, they will go for raw Side B early on to catch you out or to tech chase

## Advantage

- Down Tilt will scoop you up and make him crouch that will let him avoid most aerials
- This can lead into a Fair and then possibly a Side B
- His Up Air is great for juggling people
- All of the Pokemon’s Smash Attacks hit hard but lots of end lag
- Incineroar has strong throws that can kill at ledge at higher percents
- His Forward Tilt is a kill move at high percents as well

## Disadvantage

- Incineroar can use his Neutral B to get you off of him (this can shield break if the 3 hit boxes all connect)
- This comes out very quick and lasts several frames
- He can use Revenge! To break combos
- Bait this out and punish or use Grabs/Command Grabs
- If Incineroar uses Revenge! Successfully, grabbing him in any form will cause him to lose his buff
- Most players use Side B almost immediately after hitting Revenge!
- Bait out Smash Attacks and his Side B to leave him vulnerable

## Off Stage

- Incineroar will almost always have to use Side B as his first recovery tool
- Be careful challenging this as they can intentionally mess up their Side B timing to leave you closer to the Blast Zone
- Making Incineroar go low will make it much harder for him to recover
- If Incineroar has to land on Stage after performing his Up B he will be very exposed to a punish 
- Just watch out for the landing hit box

## Stage Picks

- Avoid tri-plats for continuous Up Airs
- Incineroar is slow so bigger stages like Town and City don’t work for him
