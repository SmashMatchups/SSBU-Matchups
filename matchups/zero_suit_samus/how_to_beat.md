# How to beat Zero Suit Samus

## Neutral

- She'll control neutral with her aerial range
- Landing hitboxes will combo into things
  - You may be stuff out her aerial approaches if she goes for landing hits only
- Nair is almost impossible to punish on shield
- Avoid playing in the corner - her kill moves are horizontal
- Her grab has a ton of end lag, so punish it well
- ZSS is light and easy to combo
- Make trades if she's lighter than you

## Disadvantage

- She'll almost certainly use Flip Kick to escape, or regain control
  - (This is her flashing backflip)
- She's invulnerable for the first half, but second half can be punished
- Footstool or jumping of your shield will be punishable
