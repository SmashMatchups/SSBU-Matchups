# How to beat Kirby 

## Neutral

- Kirby approaches from the ground
- Typically uses bait and punish style
- Basic strategy then is to force him to approach, as his approaches are all bad
  - Camp with projectiles if you can


## Disadvantage

- Drift away - his slow speed will allow you to escape
- Be careful shielding on platforms, he'll suck you up

## Advantage

- Kirby has no good landing hitboxes - juggle away
  - Obviously keep an eye out for his down B
