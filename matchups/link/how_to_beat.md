# How to beat Link 

## Neutral

- Link will Nair a lot, it's extremely safe, and a great combo starter
- Pay attention to what he does after Nair, that's when you can punish
- Be patient. Link has projectiles and may spam you until you approach.
- If you rush in, you can be punished, often with fair
- Boomerang can be beaten by a lot of moves, figure out which one is the quickest to get rid of it with.

## Disadvantage

- Despite his scary looking dair, juggling link is pretty effective
- Be careful about dair, but it's extremely punishable if you see it coming.

## Misc

- His Up-B isn't a multihit - it just looks like it. Once you block the first hit, drop shield and punish
