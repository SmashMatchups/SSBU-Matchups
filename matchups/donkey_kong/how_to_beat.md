# How to beat Donkey Kong 

## Neutral

- Donkey Kong is very punishable on approach.
- If you can, zone him out with projectiles to force an approach.
- If you're a rushdown, watch out for his tilts, which can wall you out.
- Donkey Kong will almost always approach with dash, bair spam, or dtilt
- Dash is very punishable - parry and punish
- Bair is punishable on shield depending on your character. Nair out of shield may be good

## Disadvantage
- Donkey Kong is awful in disadvantage. 
- He has low air mobility, and is massive, juggling is a good way to rack up damage.
- He'll Down B or Down Air above you - be careful for surprise b reverses.
- Ledge options are not great, just be careful he doesn't shield break you with side B

## Grabs

- When grabbed, mash.
- DK loves to use offstage throws for stage spikes. But don't freak out, you can tech these spikes up to 160 or so.
  - After teching, you can even spike or footstool him back sometimes
- On platforms, up throw combos into uair - be careful of grabs at high health
