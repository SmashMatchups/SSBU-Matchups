# How to Beat Byleth

## Neutral

- Byleth will more than likely safely approach with Nair
- They can also fish for Down Tilt to start combos at low percents
- Byleth hits hard but is quite slow and sluggish
- Feign an approach to see what moves (if any) they throw out
- Neutral B, Down B, and Smash Attacks can all be punished hard
- Up Tilt is also a good combo starter

## Advantage

- Byleth has great reach and properties on all of their Smash Attacks
- The same goes for their Fair and Bair
- They’ll also look to juggle you with Up Airs where possible
- Outmaneuvering Byleth is key to overcoming them
- Byleth wants to pressure you into pressing buttons
- Retreat to ledge for the I-Frames or be on point to tech landings
- Byleth can punish rolls or slow moves easily

## Disadvantage

- Up Tilt is a great move for Byleth to use if you’re close to them
- Nair out of shield is also common
- Nair lasts longer than most people think, so hold shield until the move is definitely finished
- Down Smash is a big gamble, but can break almost full shields if it connects and hits on both sides

## Off Stage

- Try to go out and meet Byleth early and/or while they’re higher up
- Byleth has bad air mobility, so making them hesitate can end up costing them dearly
- Be careful if trying to spike from directly above as their Up B can pull you down and spike instantly
- Byleths usually use Side B in line or just above the ledge to cover their ledge grab

## Stage Picks

- Banning FD will mean you have platforms to retreat to so you can dodge his Neutral B projectile
- If you play a fast character, take Byleth to Smashville or Yoshi’s Story
