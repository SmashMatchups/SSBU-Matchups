# How to beat Ness 

## Neutral

- Ness creates unpredictable chaos with his:
  - Strong aerials
  - PK Fire
  - Magnet reverses
- But luckily his aerials don't have a ton of range


## Disadvantage

- Get Ness into a juggle situation if possible
  - He is floaty, and you can rack up damage this way
- Be careful when edgeguarding - his recovery mixups are good
  - DONT GET THUNDERSLAMMED.
  - Don't jump out if it's too late to stop his recovery.
- Airdodge recoveries can be twoframed

## Advantage

- Ness might spam PK Thunder at you - learn which attacks clash with it, so you don't have to dodge
- How to avoid Yo-Yo edge blocking:
  - Recover quick, so he can't set it up
  - Recover high (it has enough end lag that it's worth a sloppy recovery)
  - Teleport from above to snap directly
