# How to beat Young Link 

## Neutral

- Young link can pressure you from all over the stage
  - Projectiles can hit you from across the stage
  - boomerang and bomb can pressure platforms
- Try to be up close and outrange his aerials
- Close enough to punish his bomb or boomerang - which are very laggy
- Most of his moves are hard to punish - go for quick tilts

## Disadvantage

- His air speed is low, and recovery is linear - rack on damage with edgeguards
- You can spike his Up B if you can be accurate for a good quick kill
