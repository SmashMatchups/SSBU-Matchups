# Mewtwo vs. Donkey Kong

## Neutral

- Lots of shadowball is how you win. He has no reflector, and is big.
- Landing a shadowball can lead into whatever combo you can pull off
- Force him to approach, and all of his approaches can be punished
- Don't go near down B, it can break your shield quickly. Jump over and punish from above.
- He may spam these double bairs, but it's not as safe as it seems. Punish with fair or nair.

## DK Disadvantage

- DK can be juggled easily with his huge hurtbox
- If offstage, you can take a stock if you play it right
  - Use SB to force an early jump or a low recovery
  - The top of his recovery has no hitbox, you can dair spike his head if you're careful
  - If you're not landing those, try fast-fall Nairing the recovery instead

## Cargo Throw

- Mash as soon as your grabbed
- Always be ready to tech the stage spike, it's techable until 140%
- Afterwards, you can try for a footstool or dair spike
- Watch out for upthrow to upair kill combos.
