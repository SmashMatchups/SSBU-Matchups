# Mewtwo vs Samus

- Samus will be charging Charge Shot in any free second
- She has more projectiles, and we'll be force to approach.
- Avoid air approaches, fair and CS will win out.
- If she has a fully charges CS - don't use confusion on missiles. She can do CS right after and hit you.
- She can 2 frame teleport - so teleport from above stage when possible
- Samus can be juggled fairly easily, upair and uptilt. If CS isn't fully charged, she may b-reverse it to mix up landing
- Be careful with shield pressure - she has great out-of-shield options
- Always DI away, to avoid fair combos
- Fair is punishable if you outspace it.
