# Mewtwo vs Rosalina and Luma

## Luma

- Your goal should be to get Luma dead asap.
- When Rosalina has Luma, she has excellent stage control and ledgetrapping
- Generally, Rosalina deals the damage, Luma has the knockback.
- Luma dies at 40% - or can be knocked off the map
- Once dead, Luma takes 10 seconds to respawn. Rosalina will avoid fighting
- Time to pressure - but be patient, and predict her movements
- SB is very effective now.

## Neutral

- She can absorb SB with "Gravitational Pull" (GP)
- But GP is laggy, and not a direct punish - so she may be less likely to use it

## Advantage

- Her recovery is quick and can be angled - so she can mix it up a lot
- However, it has no hitbox, so we can punish it.
- Down Smash twoframing is a safe option
- Nair at the edge can catch her recovery

## Disadvantage

- She can juggle well and her she has many disjoints, this will make you want to go for the ledge
- However, with Luma, her ledgetrapping is really good
- A good Rosalina will cover all getups at once with herself and Luma
  - To get around this, drop down and upair back up.
- Don't hang on to the ledge past invincibility - she has a frame 6 down smash
