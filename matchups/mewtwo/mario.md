# Mewtwo vs. Mario

## Neutral

- Nair eats fireballs, so don't worry about spam. Nair through them, into Mario
- His reflector is laggy, get him to use it a lot by charging, but not throwing SB
- When juggling, don't meet him early - wait for an attack, then punish

## Disadvantage

- When in disadvantage, try to get to ledge if possible
- Teleport to ledge from above, to avoid 2 frames
- Use tilts to outrange him, don't get up close
- When he uses an aerial, don't punish with Nair, it won't work
- Instead, space them out for a whiff punish, or reset.
