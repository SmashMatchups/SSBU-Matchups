# Mewtwo vs. Link

## Neutral

- Link may force you to approach with his projectiles, then combo start with nair or fair.
- His landing aerials are all safe on shield. To punish you'll have to parry, or space them out
- Don't spam confusion, but sending boomerang or arrows back with it can force his approach
- Nair eats boomerangs, and boomerangs are laggy. Nair through boomerangs into Link
- His up special is not a multihit. Dodge or shield the first hit, then punish severely


## Link Disadvantage

- Don't be afraid to juggle, just keep his dair in mind
- Dair is a big commitment, and can be punished nicely
- High recoveries can be punished with bair
