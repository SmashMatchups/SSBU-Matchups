# Mewtwo vs Palutena

## Neutral
- This is a tough matchup that favors Palutena
- She can reflect SB, and has her own projectiles - so she can outcamp us
- Charge SB far away from her, she can close distance quickly
- Only throw out a fully charged SB if it's completely safe - or to punish AR
- Palutena is strongest in the air - use utilt more than dtilt
- Nair has less priority than all of her aerials
- Don't try to punish her fair or bair out of shield - parry if you can
  - Instead learn her habits *after* the fair or bair, and punish/predict those.
- Don't bother reflecting AR unless it's being predictably spammed
- Reflecting EF is a good option - but don't run in after

## Advantage
- You can juggle with upair a bit, but a good Palutena will warp down, if you're too aggressive.
