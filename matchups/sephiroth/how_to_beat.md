# How to Beat Sephiroth

## Neutral

- Sephiroth wants you running into him as much as possible
- Avoid landing on him as his Up Smash covers a great area above him
- If he throws out Omnislash a lot, simply hold shield and punish after, the move has a ton of end lag
- Sephiroth will usually have a Shadow Flare on deck
- Be warned that he can turn and launch this quickly
- He’ll use the shadow orbs to distract and pressure you into shielding
- Ignore them for a short time, they won’t hurt you until 5-6 seconds after touching you
  - Be careful when shielding the shadow orbs - that combined with a smash can break your shields
  - You can go to ledge and use ledge getups to block them for free potentially

## Advantage

- He has a tipper effect like Lucina, so he wants you at around arms length due to his much bigger sword
- Sephiroths can launch Onmislash if they’re feeling confident or as a surprise move, and landing this will cause big damage and can kill surprisingly early
- Be aware that shielding too much will mean Sephiroth can land heavy blows on you with his sword, all of which do good shield damage

## Disadvantage

- Projectile characters will have a much easier time against him
- His moves cover a large area, but are very laggy and leave him open
- Work out your opponents timing for how and when they swing to know when to exploit them
- If you’re confident you know their timing, Air Dodge through their attack and punish before they can react

## Off Stage

- Most Sephiroths will launch Gigaflare to make you fear the area above or around the ledge
- He can also use Scintilla to intercept recoveries that put out a hurt box like Ness’ PK Thunder or Fox’s Fire Fox
- Always respect his Octaslash recovery and be aware that it will hit past the ledge with its large hit box
- However take note if your opponent is charging their Up B, as this means they won’t snap ledge until after the move finishes
- If you challenge him off stage, try to do it early before he can think about using his Octaslash to catch him off guard

## Stage Picks

- Stay away from platform stages like Battlefield
- Sephiroth can use Down Air to poke through platforms and his Up Tilt/Up Smash shark, covering the whole platform
- FD, T&C, and Kalos are better places to take him to
