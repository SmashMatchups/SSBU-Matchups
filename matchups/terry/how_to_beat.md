# How to Beat Terry

## Neutral

- Terry can hit very hard and has very good frame data
- Terry is notorious for his “Jab, Jab, Power Dunk” combo
- He can use Power Wave to get you to move towards him 
- He can follow this by intercepting you with his Nair, or by using either of his Side B (Forward or Reverse Side B)
- Terry can also Spot Dodge Cancel with his Jab

## Advantage

- It’s very hard to beat Terry out of shield, so he’ll want to be right on your shield if he can
- Rolling can be ineffective against Terry as he has auto-turnaround like Ken and Ryu
- You can either Tech Roll to get extra distance from him or use Get Up Attack
- At low percents Terry can Grab + Down Throw to get a good damage combo off
- If the player is reckless, they will look to use his KO moves as soon as they have them

## Disadvantage

- Being a Shoto, Terry wants to be grounded for his combos
- Keep him in the air as much as you can
- You can also camp with projectiles to frustrate him
- When juggling, he’ll most likely use his Nair to break your combo as that’s his fastest aerial

## Off Stage

- Terry won’t want to challenge you off stage much, he will prefer to ledge trap you
- He can catch Neutral Get Up and Jump Get Up with his Burning Knuckle (Side B Forward)
- He can do the same with Power Geyser (when he has access to it)
- Terry’s Up B does not snap ledge, so moves like Captain Falcon’s Down Tilt, Falco’s Down Tilt, or some characters Down Smashes can knock him away easily
- Most Terry’s will use Burning Knuckle in line with or above ledge to recover horizontally

## Stage Picks

- Terry will want FD and Smashville to be close to you (and for the lack of platforms)
- Take him to Town and City, Battlefield, or Lylat
