# How to Beat Bowser Jr

## Neutral

- Bowser Jr’s best attribute is his ability to mix up his options quickly to keep you guessing
- He doesn’t have too much in the way of shield pressure, but his Side B (coupled with its super armor) can get him in close to you for grabs if you constantly shield
- Often players will use Down B to launch a Mechakoopa to control your ground movement and make you jump
- Focus on avoiding the projectile but not closing distance too much. A smart player will condition you into running towards his Nair or Forward Air

## Advantage

- The Koopaling’s main way of racking up damage on you will be juggling
- Often the player will use Up Tilt (sometimes as an out of shield option) and then juggle you with Up Air’s
- At low percents they’ll finish the combo by pushing you further out with Forward Air
- At high/kill percent they usually go for an Up B followed up by the strong aerial attack they have access to when out of the clown car

## Disadvantage

- Frustration is a great way to exploit Bowser Jr players
- Bait and condition them into using their Side B and/or grabbing as the Koopa Kid’s grab is slow and has poor range
- Use this to punish him with your own characters strengths
- Alternatively, a character with good projectiles like Link, Samus, or Ness can out-zone Bowser Jr effectively

## Off Stage

- When Bowser Jr has you off stage, they can use their Neutral B (Cannonball) and Down B (Mechakoopa) to intercept your recovery
- They commonly use their Up B off stage to drop the clown car explosive hurt box in line with or below the ledge 
- Going high can be a safer option, but try to mix up recovery heights to avoid being predictable
- He can also pressure at ledge with his Forward and Down Smash, so don’t continually use the same type of get-up option
- His Forward Tilt can also be angled down to two-frame
- When you have Bowser Jr off stage, try and get cut out his recovery early
- Players often go low, use Side B to recovery horizontally, jump, then Up B
- Taking away just one of these resource will make it very hard for Bowser Jr to make it back to stage

## Stage Picks

- -Bowser Jr doesn’t have any major strength stages but avoiding tri-plats will stop him from performing continuous ladder combos
- It’s a good idea to ban Yoshi’s Story and Kalos as the small horizontal blast zones mean that he can kill you early if he catches your neutral get-up with an F-Smash or even a rapid jab
