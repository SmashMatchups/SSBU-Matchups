# How to beat Luigi 

## Zero To Death

- Depending on your character - you can be zero-to-death comboed from grabs at 0% to 15% or so
- Avoid grabs as much as possible in general. Camp platforms or projectile spam if you must
- After 15%, grabs aren't as bad, but still to be avoided

## Neutral

- Luigi is slow, and can be walled out with good disjoints or projectiles
- Keep extra good spacing, since his up b can also kill very early

## Disadvantage

- Luigi's airspeed is very slow, so he's good juggle food
- But be very careful of his down special - it comes out quick and is a great move
  - If you predict it, it's very punishable
