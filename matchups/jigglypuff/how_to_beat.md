# How to beat Jigglypuff 

## Neutral

- Jigglypuff will stay in the air
- She'll keep poking you with her safe options, until you make a mistake
- Anti-airs and spacing is the name of the game. Lots of patience
- Don't stick on your shields two long. Her side B will break it in two hits.
- Find an opening and then go ham

## Disadvantage

- She's very floaty, and has a million jumps, so you may not be able to execute combos on her
- But she's very juggleable - so keep bouncing her up
